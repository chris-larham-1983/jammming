## General Information

This is my solution to the **Codecademy** portfolio project entitled *Jammming*, wherein I had to design 
a **React app** that allows users to create custom playlists and save them to their *Spotify* account.

A follow-up project involved identifying a new feature that could be added to the *Jammming* app.  I chose 
to add an 'AUTHENTICATE' button that allows the user to initiate the authentication process, thus separating 
the authentication logic from the 'SEARCH' logic.  This feature also set the expiry of the *Spotify* access 
token more accurately, enhancing the user experience.  

Further details of the follow-up project can be read in the accompanying '**Jammming Feature Design Document**'.

## Technologies
  
I wrote this **React app** primarily using *ReactJS* and *JSX*.  I also modified the *CSS* to provide the user 
with two neatly-designed informative paragraphs that explain the app's authentication requirements.  I used 
vanilla *JavaScript* to add a function that is invoked when the *onload* event fires.

Further details of my usage of *ReactJS*, *JSX*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript* can be read in the accompanying 
'**Jammming Feature Design Document**'.
